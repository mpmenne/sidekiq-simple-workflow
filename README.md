# Sidekiq::SimpleWorkflow
This is a *very simple* wrapper around the [Sidekiq Batches API](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Batches).

Where as other gems recreate the full power of creating complex, fully parallel workflows, this gem does the opposite.  It offers up to 10 steps that are run sequentially.  Each step can have a very large number of parallel jobs.  Only once all of the parallel jobs for a step have been completed, the call back for the next step will be triggered.

Here is an example:
```
class SimpleWorkflow
  include Sidekiq::SimpleWorkflow

  def step_1(status, options)
    SomeJob.perform_async
    SomeOtherJob.perform_async
  end

  def step_2(status, options)
    ThenRunThisJob.perform_async
  end
end
```

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'sidekiq-simple_workflow'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sidekiq-simple_workflow
